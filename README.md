# Driver Performance Prediction
Formula 1 (F1 or Formula One), a competitive motor racing series, is a data-driven sport that generates a large amount of data during races, including car telemetry, performance metrics, driver details, and race results. This study aims to build machine learning models to evaluate the impact of certain variables on driver performance prediction, such as qualifying position, starting grid position, lap times, pit stops, historical performance (points) and constructors. Data was collected from an API and analyzed using data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a machine learning model.
